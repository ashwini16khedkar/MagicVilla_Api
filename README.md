# MagicVilla_API
RESTful API with .NET Core (.NET7)

After working as backend-devolper at BEE-ideas working on a project for Visual Contracts (May-Nov 2022), I went back to self-study again in December 2022. Goals: more indepth of C# / and increasing my knowledge on building Web API's. This was a short course / and a quick recap of the basics of building an ASP.NET Core Web API. This time using .NET7. A lot of repetition of skills I already have mastered before.
